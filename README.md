This is a cleanup of the code used to generate [this visualization](https://www.reddit.com/comments/153somz) of Taskmaster contestants' strengths and weaknesses.

Running `ruby generate_plots.rb` will fill out the template with the appropriate values from the `data` file (obtained with [this query](https://prettygr.im/tdlm/taskmaster?sql=select+c.name+contestant%2C+c.champion%2C%0D%0A++round%2875+%2A+percent_rank%28%29+over+%28order+by+avg%28case+when+tags+like+%27%25solo%25%27+then+a.points+end%29%29%2C+1%29+solo%2C%0D%0A++round%2875+%2A+percent_rank%28%29+over+%28order+by+avg%28case+when+tags+like+%27%25objective%25%27+then+a.points+end%29%29%2C+1%29+objective%2C%0D%0A++round%2875+%2A+percent_rank%28%29+over+%28order+by+avg%28case+when+tags+like+%27%25live%25%27+then+a.points+end%29%29%2C+1%29+live%2C%0D%0A++round%2875+%2A+percent_rank%28%29+over+%28order+by+avg%28case+when+tags+like+%27%25physical%25%27+then+a.points+end%29%29%2C+1%29+physical%2C%0D%0A++round%2875+%2A+percent_rank%28%29+over+%28order+by+avg%28case+when+tags+like+%27%25team%25%27+then+a.points+end%29%29%2C+1%29+team%2C%0D%0A++round%2875+%2A+percent_rank%28%29+over+%28order+by+avg%28case+when+tags+like+%27%25subjective%25%27+then+a.points+end%29%29%2C+1%29+subjective%2C%0D%0A++round%2875+%2A+percent_rank%28%29+over+%28order+by+avg%28case+when+tags+like+%27%25prize%25%27+then+a.points+end%29%29%2C+1%29+prize%2C%0D%0A++round%2875+%2A+percent_rank%28%29+over+%28order+by+avg%28case+when+tags+like+%27%25mental%25%27+then+a.points+end%29%29%2C+1%29+mental%0D%0Afrom+attempts+a%0D%0A++join+tasks+t+on+t.id+%3D+a.task%0D%0A++join+people+c+on+c.id+%3D+a.contestant%0D%0A++join+series_scores+ss+on+ss.contestant+%3D+c.id%0D%0Awhere+std+and+c.series+%3E+0%0D%0Agroup+by+c.id%0D%0Aorder+by+c.series%2C+ss.rank%2C+c.name&_size=max&_hide_sql=1)) and pass it along to `gnuplot`, which will generate an individual SVG file for each of the 75 rows/contestants. I know Gnuplot has great support for multiplots, but I figured it'd be easier to shell out from Ruby and do the post-processing with ImageMagick.

With the plots generated, `montage *.svg -geometry '+0+0' -tile 5x15 out.png` will arrange them into a single image (one row per series), and then a wee `mogrify -negate out.png` will make the final result pretty enough to share on the internet.
